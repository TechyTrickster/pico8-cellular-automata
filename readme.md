# Cell

This is a small 'game' that I wrote to help teach myself the Pico-8 Fantasy console's Lua dialect and some of it's APIs.  The 'game' itself is an implementation of the classic 8-bit one dimensional cellular automata simulation.  Using a custom implemented menu system, you can change the starting world generation rules, the simulation rule itself, and the colorization rules.
